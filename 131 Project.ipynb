    "This dataset came from Kaggle.  The user that it belongs to is listed as Jesse Vent or \"jvent\".  In the About Me section of his profile it says \"Senior data analyst and machine learning enthusiast, working on large scale public service ICT projects\".  It also says he's from Adelaide, Australia and that his preferred languages are R \"and a little python\".\n",

    "For starters, cryptocurrencies in Merriam-Webster Dictionary is defined as  \"any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to preven counterfeiting and fradulent transactions\".  Merriam-Webster also provides an example, \"Virtual currency bitcoin hit the mainstream in 2014. Bitcoin ATMs started springing up all over the world … , allowing people to exchange cash for the cryptocurrency, a secure digital payment outside of conventional financial institutions. —Brenda Poppy\"\n",

    "Wikipedia describes it as \"digita asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets\".\n",

    "These definitions are quite close and from what I understand its a digital currency that is massively unregulated.  Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009, is the most well-known.  Wikipedia says since then over 4,000 alterative coins have been created.\n",
